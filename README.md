# Quantitative Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various quantitative analyses related to financial and commodity markets. Each notebook is self-contained and includes detailed comments explaining the methodology and purpose of the analysis.

## Background


- Completing a simulation focused on quantitative research methods.
- Analyzing a book of loans to estimate a customer's probability of default using logistic regression and decision tree models.
- Implementing statistical methods to convert FICO scores into categorical data for predicting loan defaults.

## Repository Structure

- **NaturalGasPriceAnalysis.ipynb**
  - This notebook conducts a time series analysis and forecasting of natural gas prices using SARIMAX models, including seasonal decomposition and prediction visualization.

- **CommodityStorageContractAnalysis.ipynb**
  - Analysis of storage contracts, including detailed cost calculations and profit analysis for commodity trading with dynamic storage options.

- **LoanDefaultRiskAnalysis.ipynb**
  - Predictive analysis using logistic regression and decision trees to assess the risk of loan defaults based on historical loan data.

- **FICOScoreDefaultsAnalysis.ipynb**
  - A statistical exploration of the relationship between FICO scores and loan defaults, employing chi-squared tests to understand the impact of credit scores on default rates.
